# C++ Demonic Quiz (Not really though, could be harder)

An interactive quiz application built with **Vue 3** and **shadcn/ui components**, with anti-cheating mechanism to fail immediately after the mouse leave the quiz screen for 10 seconds.  

There is a **studentID** and **passcode** system for entering the quiz screen, and the **startcode** to start the quiz.
(Though currently, anything that matches the regex is valid.)
